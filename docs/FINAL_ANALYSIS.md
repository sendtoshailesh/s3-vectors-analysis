- **S3 Vectors**: Moderate throughput at 25 QPS
- **OpenSearch**: Limited throughput at 1.5 QPS (instance constrained)

## üéØ Use Case Decision Matrix

### ‚úÖ Choose S3 Vectors When:
- **Cost optimization is the primary concern** (80% cost savings)
- **Latency requirements are >200ms** (batch processing acceptable)
- **Workload characteristics**:
  - Batch processing and analytics
  - Large-scale document search
  - Recommendation systems with offline processing
  - Research and development environments
  - Archival systems with occasional queries

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider Alternatives When:
- **Real-time applications** requiring <100ms latency
- **High-frequency queries** (>50 QPS sustained)
- **Interactive user-facing features** with strict SLA requirements
- **Complex query patterns** beyond vector similarity

## üèóÔ∏è Real Infrastructure Deployed

### AWS Services Used
- **S3 Bucket**: `s3-vector-benchmark-mshailes-2025`
- **OpenSearch Domain**: `vector-benchmark-mshailes` (t3.small.search)
- **PostgreSQL RDS**: `vector-benchmark-postgres` (db.t3.micro)
- **Bedrock**: Titan embeddings for vector generation

### Testing Methodology
1. **Real AWS deployment** using Isengard profile
2. **Actual vector embeddings** generated via Bedrock Titan
3. **Live performance measurement** across all services
4. **Production-ready configurations** with proper indexing

## üìà Business Impact

### Cost Savings Scenarios
For a typical application with 1M queries/month:
- **S3 Vectors**: $4.90/month
- **OpenSearch**: $20.60/month  
- **PostgreSQL**: $12.70/month

**Annual savings with S3 Vectors**: $188 vs OpenSearch, $94 vs PostgreSQL

### Performance Acceptability
- **S3 Vectors 261ms**: Acceptable for batch processing, analytics, content discovery
- **PostgreSQL 145ms**: Good for mixed workloads, moderate real-time needs
- **OpenSearch 649ms**: Poor performance on small instances, needs scaling

## üöÄ Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Adopt S3 Vectors** for cost-sensitive batch workloads
2. **Keep PostgreSQL** for applications requiring <200ms latency
3. **Avoid small OpenSearch instances** for production workloads

### Architecture Patterns
```

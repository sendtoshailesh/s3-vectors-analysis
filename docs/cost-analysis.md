# Cost Analysis: S3 Vectors vs Alternatives

## Executive Summary

S3 Vectors delivers **4.2x better cost efficiency** than OpenSearch and **2.6x better** than PostgreSQL, making it the clear choice for cost-sensitive vector workloads.

## Monthly Cost Breakdown

### S3 Vectors: $32/month
- **S3 Storage**: $15 (100GB at $0.023/GB)
- **S3 Requests**: $12 (1M GET requests at $0.0004/1K)
- **Data Transfer**: $5 (estimated)

### OpenSearch: $159/month  
- **t3.small.search**: $159 (24/7 instance)
- **EBS Storage**: Included in instance cost
- **Data Transfer**: Minimal (same VPC)

### PostgreSQL: $89/month
- **db.t3.micro**: $89 (24/7 RDS instance)
- **Storage**: $2 (20GB at $0.10/GB)
- **Backup**: Included in first 20GB

## Cost per Query Analysis

### Calculation Methodology
Based on 1,000,000 queries per month:

| Service | Monthly Cost | Cost per 1K Queries | Efficiency vs S3 |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| S3 Vectors | $32 | $0.0049 | **Baseline** |
| OpenSearch | $159 | $0.0206 | 4.2x more expensive |
| PostgreSQL | $89 | $0.0127 | 2.6x more expensive |

## Scaling Cost Projections

### 10M Queries/Month
- **S3 Vectors**: $49 (+53% due to request scaling)
- **OpenSearch**: $159 (no change, fixed instance cost)
- **PostgreSQL**: $89 (no change, fixed instance cost)

### 100M Queries/Month
- **S3 Vectors**: $320 (linear scaling with requests)
- **OpenSearch**: $500+ (requires larger instances)
- **PostgreSQL**: $300+ (requires larger instances)

## Break-Even Analysis

### When OpenSearch Becomes Competitive
OpenSearch becomes cost-competitive at **~50M queries/month** when S3 request costs scale linearly but OpenSearch can handle higher throughput on the same instance.

### When PostgreSQL Becomes Competitive  
PostgreSQL remains cost-competitive until **~25M queries/month** due to better throughput per dollar.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### S3 Vectors Optimization
1. **Intelligent Tiering**: Move old vectors to IA storage
2. **Request Optimization**: Batch queries when possible
3. **Caching**: Implement application-level caching
4. **Compression**: Use efficient vector encoding

### OpenSearch Optimization
1. **Reserved Instances**: 30-50% savings with 1-year commitment
2. **Right-sizing**: Start with t3.small, scale based on usage
3. **Index Optimization**: Reduce storage with proper mapping

### PostgreSQL Optimization
1. **Reserved Instances**: 30-40% savings with commitment
2. **Connection Pooling**: Reduce instance requirements
3. **Read Replicas**: Scale read workloads cost-effectively

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

### 3-Year TCO Comparison (1M queries/month)
- **S3 Vectors**: $1,152 (pure operational cost)
- **OpenSearch**: $5,724 (+ development complexity)
- **PostgreSQL**: $3,204 (+ maintenance overhead)

### Hidden Costs
- **Development Time**: S3 Vectors requires custom implementation
- **Operational Overhead**: OpenSearch needs cluster management
- **Monitoring**: All solutions need performance monitoring
- **Backup/Recovery**: PostgreSQL has built-in solutions

## ROI Analysis

### Cost Savings with S3 Vectors
- **vs OpenSearch**: $127/month = $1,524/year
- **vs PostgreSQL**: $57/month = $684/year

### Break-even Timeline
S3 Vectors pays for additional development time within **2-3 months** due to operational cost savings.

## Recommendations

### Choose S3 Vectors When:
- Monthly query volume < 10M
- Cost optimization is primary concern
- Development resources available for custom implementation
- Batch processing acceptable (>200ms latency)

### Choose PostgreSQL When:
- Balanced cost/performance requirements
- Need SQL compatibility
- Mixed workload (OLTP + vector search)
- Team familiar with PostgreSQL

### Choose OpenSearch When:
- Performance is critical (<100ms)
- High query volume (>50M/month)
- Need advanced search features
- Budget allows for premium solution

## Cost Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Cost per Query**: Monthly spend / query count
2. **Utilization Rate**: Actual vs provisioned capacity
3. **Scaling Efficiency**: Cost increase vs performance gain
4. **Hidden Costs**: Development, maintenance, monitoring

### Alerting Thresholds
- S3 Vectors: Alert if cost/query > $0.01
- OpenSearch: Alert if utilization < 50%
- PostgreSQL: Alert if connection count > 80%

---

**Bottom Line**: S3 Vectors delivers exceptional cost efficiency for applications that can accept 200-300ms latency in exchange for 80% cost savings.
